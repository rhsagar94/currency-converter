Description:

My project is about knowing the exchange rate of all the currencies all over the world. Being an immigrant, very often I have to check at the exchange rate of my home currency before making any transactions. That gave me the idea of making a website where not only you can see the exchange rate of a currency also you can calculate the amount you want to convert.
